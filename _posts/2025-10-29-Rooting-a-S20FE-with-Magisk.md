Rooting is the process of gaining elevated privileges on a comparatively restricted device, such as a phone. In this walkthrough, we will run through the process of rooting a phone (S20FE 5G, `r8q`) running LineageOS 23 (Android 16).
We will be installing Magisk by sideloading it here.

### Rebooting into sideload using `adb`

Firstly, ensure that USB Debugging is enabled on your device. I am using an S20FE running LineageOS 23.
Then, connect your device to your computer with a data USB cable. Unlock your phone, and you should get a prompt asking you to allow USB Debugging:

After allowing this, we can then navigate to our terminal and reboot our device into recovery mode:
```bash
adb reboot sideload
```

After this, we will now be in Lineage's recovery mode where we can install the Magisk `.zip`. Navigate to the [official Magisk Repo](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases/) and download an APK file for flashing

_(I used `v30.0`)_

Now, we can begin flashing. Before flashing, double-check that the device is in sideload mode:
```bash
adb devices
```

Now, we can patch the `.apk` to our device:
```bash
adb -d sideload Magisk-v30.0.apk
```

We may get a notice with something such as `Signature Verification Failed`. This is expected, and we can just continue.

After a successful installation, we can boot into our phone as normal and we should successfully be rooted ðŸŽ‰

Check the newly-installed "Magisk" app to ensure root was successfully installed.
