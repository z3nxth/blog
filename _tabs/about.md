Hey! I'm Iftekhar. I'm a self-proclaimed hardware/software pentester (doing certs!). I've always loved hacking, from RF Exploitation to OSCP-like software penetration testing and CTFs.

My interest in cybersecurity began when I was very little, learning about different hardware protocols like NFC, RFID and SubGHZ. I couldn't help but wonder about their vulnerabilities, and so I began my journey in cybersecurity one day with a Raspberry Pi, and an RFID scanner and emulator module. Being able to scan and emulate access cards gave the child me joy that flourished into today's passion for system pentesting.
